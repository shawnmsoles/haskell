-- ghc --make haskelltut compiles your program and executes the main function

-- Functions must start with lowercase letters

-- We can define functions and values in the GHCi with let
-- let num7 = 7
-- let getTriple x = x * 3

-- getTriple num7 = 21

-- main is a function that can be called in the terminal with main
main = do
    -- Prints the string with a new line
    putStrLn "What's your name: "

    -- Gets user input and stores it in name
    -- <- Pulls the name entered from an IO action
    name <- getLine

    putStrLn ("Hello " ++ name)

-- Create function addMe
-- x is a parameter and the operation follows the equals sign
-- The data type passed in will work if it makes sense
-- Every function must return something
-- A function name can't begin with a capital letter
-- A function that doesn't receive parameters is called a definition or name

-- You can define a type declaration for functions
-- funcName :: param1 -> param2 -> returnType
addMe :: Int -> Int -> Int

-- funcName param1 param2 = operations (Returned Value)
-- Execute with : addMe 4 5
addMe x y = x + y

-- Without type declaration you can add floats as well
sumMe x y = x + y

-- You can also add tuples : addTuples (1,2) (3,4) = (4,6)
addTuples :: (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int) -> (Int, Int)
addTuples (x, y) (x2, y2) = (x + x2, y + y2)

-- You can perform different actions based on values

-- Define that we expect an Int in and out
factorial :: Int -> Int

-- If 0 return a 1 (Recursive Function)
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)

-- 3 * factorial (2) : 6
-- 2 * factorial (1) : 2
-- 1 * factorial (0) : 1

-- You could also use product to calculate factorial
productFactorial n = product [1..n]

-- We can use guards that provide different actions based on conditions
isOdd :: Int -> Bool
isOdd n
    -- if the modulus using 2 equals 0 return False
    | n `mod` 2 == 0 = False

    -- Else return True
    | otherwise = True

-- This could be shortened to
isEven n = n `mod` 2 == 0

-- Use guards to define the school to output
